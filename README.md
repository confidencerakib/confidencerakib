## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**confidencerakib/confidencerakib** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

![I am GitHub Readme Generator's creator](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5616AQEm5NaLiQaBqA/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/0/1693913189801?e=1743033600&v=beta&t=1fqbOSSjTpYlbusnzc4pHJP-R9CPzxWP5R8Arb7P6ow)

I made this project just for fun, it allows you to create nice and simple GitHub Readme files that you can copy/paste and use in your profile.

Skills: VUE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
